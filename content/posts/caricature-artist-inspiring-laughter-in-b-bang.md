title: Caricature artist inspiring laughter in B’bang

  At first glance, the face staring back at Phen Lina from the artist’s page – with its huge lips, symmetrically over-inflated cheeks, and eyelashes longer than the whiskers on a cat – was just a silly cartoon-style caricature drawn for her amusement.

  But after a few moments of giggling at the absurd face that the artist drew for her, she realized that it really was an accurate – though wildly exaggerated – likeness of her. He got the shape of her face, her mouth and her hair-style spot on.

  “Even though it was just a cartoon, I could recognize my face particularly my mouth, eyes and hair,” said Lina, who sent an original photo of herself to the artist – who then drew the caricature portrait for her and sent it to her via Facebook Messenger.

  If you’re feeling bored, tired and a little bit fed up with life in the Covid-19 era at the moment, you might get a few chuckles out of having a caricature of yourself drawn up by the young Battambang artist Thuokna Sin.

  Known for its rich culture and history, Battambang still has some of its colonial-era buildings left standing today. Some of them were featured in the Hollywood movie about Cambodia First They Killed My Father produced by Angelina Jolie.

  It is also famous as the home of the legendary golden voiced singer Sin Sisamuth and today it features the Phare Ponleu Selpak circus and arts academy, which is busy teaching the next generation of Cambodian artists and performers.

  The provincial town has charmed visitors with its under-the-radar but flourishing performing and visual arts scenes, both traditional and contemporary in nature.

One of the least publicized and celebrated forms of art in Battambang are the affordable and popular caricature drawings being done for tourists and curious locals, especially youths.

Even the process of sitting and waiting for a caricature artist to draw a funny portrait of you is entertaining – because of the anticipation – and the fact that you can’t see what they are busy creating but your friends and anyone passing by can.

Thuokna, 26, was born in Battambang and is originally from the Moung Ruessei district, is the artist best known for creating these caricatures and he says he tries to strike a balance between making fun of his customers while keeping them laughing too so there are no hard feelings.

“The key point for these funny cartoons is always the shape of their face and the eyes, mouth and hair. It does take skill as an artist to capture enough of what’s real so that they can recognize themselves because if they can’t then the joke \[portrait\] just isn’t funny,” he says.

Prior to the general outbreak of Covid-19 in the Kingdom, Thuokna had more chances to create and show his artwork in exchange for some income to support his family and continue to pursue his broader dreams in the art field.

Before the pandemic struck, he would carry his drawing pad and pencils and go from event to event, night after night, getting paid to draw caricatures of the guests as a fun attraction at various public gatherings.

Thuokna told The Post that “I was booked for a lot of different events like condo warming parties, wedding receptions, birthday parties, school parties and other celebrations all over town.”
